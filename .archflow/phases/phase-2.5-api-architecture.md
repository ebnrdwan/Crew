# Phase 2.5: API Architecture

## 🎯 Phase Objective
Create comprehensive API contracts that serve as the single source of truth for frontend/backend integration.

## 📋 Required Agents
- `api-contract-architect` - Creates API contracts from wireframes/requirements

## 📚 Prerequisites
- Phase 2 outputs: `design-artifacts/wireframes/`, `design-artifacts/styled-dsl.yaml`
- Phase 2.25 outputs: `design-artifacts/hifi-screens/` (visual reference for API design)
- `.crew/current-feature.yaml` defining active development scope
- User approval from Phase 2.25

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Contract-First Development
Define all API contracts before any implementation begins.

```bash
api-contract-architect: design-artifacts/wireframes/ + current-feature.yaml → docs/api-contract.md
```

## 📤 Expected Outputs
- `docs/api-contract.md` - Complete API specifications including:
  - All endpoint definitions (paths, methods, parameters)
  - Request/response schemas and examples
  - Authentication requirements
  - Error response formats and codes
  - Data validation rules

## ✅ Completion Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints defined for current feature scope
- [ ] Request/response schemas documented with examples
- [ ] Authentication and authorization specified
- [ ] Error handling patterns established
- [ ] API contracts align with wireframes and DSL specifications
- [ ] Frontend and backend teams can work independently using contracts

## 🚨 Critical Requirements
- **CONTRACT COMPLETENESS**: Every frontend data need must have corresponding API endpoint
- **SCHEMA PRECISION**: All request/response formats must be explicitly defined
- **ERROR SPECIFICATIONS**: All possible error scenarios must be documented
- **USER APPROVAL MANDATORY**: Present API contracts to user and wait for explicit approval
- **NO PROCEEDING**: Do not move to Phase 3 without approval
- **FEATURE SCOPE**: Only create contracts for features defined in `.crew/current-feature.yaml`

## 💡 Why This Phase Is Critical
- Enables **parallel development** in Phase 3
- Eliminates **integration issues** and back-and-forth
- Provides **single source of truth** for both frontend and backend
- Reduces **development time** by 40-50%

## Phase Completion: Commit Artifacts

Before transitioning to the next phase, commit all artifacts:
```bash
git add docs/api-contract.md
git commit -m "docs: complete Phase 2.5 - API contract"
```

## Phase Transition Validation

Before updating `current-phase.yaml`, verify:

1. **Artifacts exist**:
   - [ ] `docs/api-contract.md` exists (or equivalent at `api_contract_path`). For `frontend_only`/`mobile`: required if app consumes external APIs (`api_contract_path` is set)

2. **Git state**:
   - [ ] All artifacts committed (`git status` shows clean tree)

3. **Approval**:
   - [ ] User explicitly approved phase outputs

If ANY check fails → HALT: "Cannot transition. Missing: [list]"
If ALL pass → update `current-phase.yaml` to next phase.

## ➡️ Phase Transition
Upon completion and approval:
1. Update `.crew/current-phase.yaml` to `phase: 3`
2. Proceed to Implementation Phase (Parallel Development)
3. Load `.crew/phases/phase-3-implementation.md` for next phase instructions
