# Phase 1: Strategy & Planning

## 🎯 Phase Objective
Define business strategy, user personas, and feature roadmap to establish project foundation.

## 📋 Required Agents
- `product-strategist` - Business strategy, user personas, KPIs, market positioning
- `feature-planner` - Feature roadmaps, user stories, epic breakdown, sprint planning

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Parallel Development
Both agents work simultaneously to maximize efficiency.

```bash
# Run in parallel
product-strategist: define business goals + target personas + KPIs → project-context.md
feature-planner: create feature roadmap + user stories + sprint plan → roadmap.yaml
```

## 📤 Expected Outputs
- `.crew/project-context.md` - Business goals, tech stack, target users, success metrics
- `.crew/roadmap.yaml` - Prioritized feature list, development phases, timeline estimates

## ✅ Completion Criteria
- [ ] Business strategy clearly defined with target market
- [ ] User personas documented with pain points
- [ ] Success metrics and KPIs established  
- [ ] Feature roadmap prioritized and estimated
- [ ] Technical stack decisions documented
- [ ] All outputs validated and approved by stakeholders

## 🚨 Critical Requirements
- **USER APPROVAL MANDATORY**: Present all outputs to user and wait for explicit approval
- **NO PROCEEDING**: Do not move to Phase 2 without approval
- **DOCUMENTATION**: All decisions must be captured in specified output files

## Phase Completion: Commit Artifacts

Before transitioning to the next phase, commit all artifacts:
```bash
git add .crew/project-context.md .crew/roadmap.yaml
git commit -m "docs: complete Phase 1 - strategy and roadmap"
```

## Phase Transition Validation

Before updating `current-phase.yaml`, verify:

1. **Artifacts exist**:
   - [ ] `.crew/project-context.md` exists
   - [ ] `.crew/roadmap.yaml` exists

2. **Git state**:
   - [ ] All artifacts committed (`git status` shows clean tree)

3. **Approval**:
   - [ ] User explicitly approved phase outputs

If ANY check fails → HALT: "Cannot transition. Missing: [list]"
If ALL pass → update `current-phase.yaml` to next phase.

## ➡️ Phase Transition
Upon completion and approval:
1. Update `.crew/current-phase.yaml` to `phase: 2`
2. Proceed to Design Phase
3. Load `.crew/phases/phase-2-design.md` for next phase instructions
