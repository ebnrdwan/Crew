# Phase 5: Launch & Operations

## 🎯 Phase Objective
Deploy application to production with CI/CD pipelines and monitoring systems.

## 📋 Required Agents
- `devops-engineer` - CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure, app store preparation
- `post-launch-analyst` - Analytics setup, user insights, performance monitoring

## 📚 Prerequisites
- All Phase 4 quality gates passed
- Complete, tested codebase ready for production
- Quality reports showing production readiness
- User approval from Phase 4

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Sequential Launch Process
DevOps first, then Analytics setup:

```bash
# Step 5A: Deployment Infrastructure
devops-engineer: setup CI/CD + deployment → .github/workflows/ + deployment/
  - Configure CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.)
  - Set up production infrastructure
  - Configure staging and production environments
  - Set up automated testing in pipelines
  - Configure deployment automation
  - Set up backup and recovery systems
  - Configure security and access controls
  - Prepare app store submissions (if mobile)

# Step 5B: Analytics & Monitoring
post-launch-analyst: setup analytics + monitoring → docs/analytics-setup.md
  - Implement analytics tracking
  - Set up performance monitoring
  - Configure error tracking and reporting
  - Set up user behavior analytics
  - Create monitoring dashboards
  - Configure alerting systems
  - Set up A/B testing infrastructure
  - Document monitoring procedures
```

## 📤 Expected Outputs
- `.github/workflows/` - Complete CI/CD pipeline configurations
- `deployment/` - Infrastructure and deployment configurations
- `docs/analytics-setup.md` - Analytics and monitoring documentation
- Production-ready deployment infrastructure
- Monitoring and analytics systems

## ✅ Completion Criteria
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines configured and tested
- [ ] Production infrastructure deployed and secured
- [ ] Automated testing integrated into deployment pipeline
- [ ] Staging environment mirrors production
- [ ] Analytics and monitoring systems operational
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting configured
- [ ] App store submissions prepared (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Production deployment ready to execute

## 🚨 Critical Requirements

### Deployment Safety
- **STAGING FIRST**: Always deploy to staging before production
- **AUTOMATED TESTING**: All tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline
- **ROLLBACK READY**: Must have tested rollback procedures
- **MONITORING**: Full monitoring must be operational before launch

### Security & Compliance
- **SECURITY REVIEW**: Production infrastructure security validated
- **ACCESS CONTROLS**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **BACKUP SYSTEMS**: Automated backup and recovery procedures
- **COMPLIANCE**: Meet all regulatory and compliance requirements

### User Approval Gates
- **PRESENT DEPLOYMENT PLAN**: Show complete launch strategy to user
- **USER APPROVAL MANDATORY**: Wait for explicit approval before actual launch
- **NO AUTONOMOUS LAUNCH**: Never deploy to production without approval

## 🎯 Launch Readiness Checklist
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: Production environment configured and tested
- [ ] **Security**: All security measures implemented and tested
- [ ] **Performance**: Infrastructure can handle expected load
- [ ] **Monitoring**: All monitoring and alerting systems operational
- [ ] **Backup**: Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] **Documentation**: All procedures documented and accessible
- [ ] **Team Readiness**: Support team trained and ready
- [ ] **Rollback**: Rollback procedures tested and ready

## 🚀 Launch Types
Choose appropriate launch strategy:
- **Soft Launch**: Limited user base, gradual rollout
- **Full Launch**: Complete user base deployment  
- **Staged Rollout**: Progressive percentage-based deployment
- **Blue-Green**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy

## ⚠️ Launch Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance Issues**: Load testing and monitoring ready
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security scanning and monitoring
- **User Experience Problems**: Analytics and user feedback systems
- **System Failures**: Monitoring, alerting, and rollback procedures

## 🔄 Launch Workflow
```yaml
Pre-Launch:
  - devops-engineer: Infrastructure + CI/CD setup
  - post-launch-analyst: Analytics + monitoring setup
  - Present complete launch plan to user
  - Wait for explicit user approval

Launch Execution:
  - Deploy to staging and validate
  - Deploy to production (user-approved only)
  - Monitor systems and user behavior
  - Ready for immediate issue response

Post-Launch Monitoring:
  - Continuous system monitoring
  - User behavior analysis
  - Performance optimization
  - Issue resolution and support
```

## ➡️ Phase Transition
After successful production deployment and stable operation:
1. Update `.crew/current-phase.yaml` to `phase: monitoring`
2. Enter ongoing monitoring and optimization mode
3. Load `.crew/phases/phase-6-enhancement.md` for future enhancements
